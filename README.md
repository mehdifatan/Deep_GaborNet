GaborNet: A Neural Network with Trainable Gabor Filters
GaborNet is a custom neural network designed to replace traditional convolutional layers with trainable Gabor filters. This architecture explores the advantages of leveraging Gabor filters for enhanced feature extraction, particularly in tasks involving edge detection, texture analysis, and spatial frequency analysis.

Features
Trainable Gabor Filters: All convolutional layers in GaborNet are replaced with Gabor filter layers that adapt during training.
Customizable Architecture: Flexible design to adjust the number of layers, filter sizes, and output dimensions for specific applications.
Integration with PyTorch: Built using PyTorch for seamless integration into existing pipelines.
